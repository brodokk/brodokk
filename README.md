### Hi I'm brodokk

I'm mainly work on NeosVR related projects when I have time for them.

For now I'm focusing to work on tool for some NeosVR community.

My two big project for the moment are a [Discord Bot]() for managing users ability to join for some NeosVR communities like [USFN](https://github.com/USFN-Neos). And also working on a service called [community_events.neos](events.neos.boltwolf.network) ([source code](https://github.com/NeosVR-Community-Projects/community_events.neos)) for showing events available in NeosVR.

I'm also working on more personal project like a [WIP python library]() for talk to the NeosVR API and an experimentation called [NeosFen](), now on hold, to have an UI to show which friend is online.
