### Hi I'm brodokk

I'm a Fennec Fox Developer.

For now my work is mainly focused on creating tools for some NeosVR communities and users when I have time for them.

My two big projects for the moment are a [Discord Bot](https://github.com/NeosVR-Community-Projects/accesslistmanager) for managing users ability to join NeosVR sessions. And a [service](https://events.neos.boltwolf.net/) ([source code](https://github.com/NeosVR-Community-Projects/community_events.neos)) for list some of the NeosVR events available.

I'm also working on some others projects that can find either pinned in my GitHub homepage or in my [repository list](https://github.com/brodokk?tab=repositories).
