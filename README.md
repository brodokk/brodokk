### Hi I'm brodokk

I'm a Fennec Fox Developer, while im posting my code on GitHub for make it easier to people to contibute to it I also have [my own space](https://brodokk.space) in the cyberspace.

For now my work is mainly focused on creating tools for some [NeosVR](https://neos.com) communities and users when I have time for them.

My two big projects for the moment are a [Discord Bot](https://github.com/NeosVR-Community-Projects/accesslistmanager) for managing users ability to join NeosVR sessions. And a [service](https://events.neos.boltwolf.net/) ([source code](https://github.com/NeosVR-Community-Projects/community_events.neos)) for list some of the NeosVR events available.

I'm also working on some others projects that can find either pinned in my [GitHub](https://github.com/brodokk) or in my [repository list](https://github.com/brodokk?tab=repositories).
